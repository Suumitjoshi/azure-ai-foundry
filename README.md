# 🔷 Azure AI Foundry

A curated collection of design patterns, sample code, and deployment templates to build scalable, secure, and production-ready AI solutions on Microsoft Azure.

## 🚀 Purpose

This repo is a foundational toolkit for developers, solution architects, and AI engineers who want to:

- Build Azure-integrated AI services using .NET and Python
- Implement GenAI use cases with Azure OpenAI and AI Search
- Learn prompt engineering, vector embeddings, and LLM orchestration
- Deploy secure, enterprise-grade AI microservices

---

## 🏗️ Architecture & Patterns

Included design patterns:
- **AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS)** – plug AI into microservices
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** – using Azure AI Search + OpenAI
- **Prompt Engineering** – dynamic, persona-based systems
- **LLM Gateway** – pattern for abstracting Azure OpenAI usage
- **Secure Deployment** – Key Vault, APIM, Private Endpoints

## Azure Services Used
Azure OpenAI
Azure AI Search
Azure Cosmos DB
Azure Key Vault
Azure App Service / AKS
Azure Blob Storage

## Security & Compliance
  Includes patterns for:
- Role-based access control
- Secure key management
- Responsible AI principles
- Private endpoint architecture
